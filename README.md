# Linear Search Algorithm Performance in JS

This application is intedend for Junior Developers who are curious about the performance of linear search implementations in Javascript. Use this as a study guide to familiarize yourself with Linear Search functions, their implementations, strengths and of course, weaknesses.

## Objectives

1. Show basic implementations of Linear Search Algorithms using vanilla JS (found in **linear.js**)
2. Show the performance (execution in milliseconds) of these implementations with a dataset of 30000 elements and various data targets (found in **performance.js**)

## DISCLAIMER

The results of each performance test are very simple and are focused purely on the time it takes a function to complete (given varying a time parameter). This application is suppose to act as a primer for Junior Dev's who want to see some applied performance tests of an algorithm that has **O(n) time complexity**. The results found in the performance.js file were produced on my personal system in a development environment and **DO NOT** necessarily reflect accurate execution times *in the wild*.

## Stack

- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Mocha & Chai

## Run 

1. run npm install in the root directory
2. To see function performances open **performance.js** and uncomment the block of functions with the specifc target pararmeter you wish to see
3. Make sure the other blocks are commented to keep your console clear and easy to understand
4. run node performance.js to see the results (in ms)

## Tests

- run npm test
